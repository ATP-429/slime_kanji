-- warp 「ケイ」
A hand grasps a thread of the warp (as opposed to the weft) in a loom, with the shuttle crossing that thread below.
Warp: the initial parallel set of threads laid in woven fabric (as opposed to the perpendicular "weft").
This has many associated meanings, such as to pass, longitude, and the sutras.
