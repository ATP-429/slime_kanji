侯
-- marquis 「コウ」
A person who carries jitte (upper right) and war arrow as his badges of office.
A marquis, originally, was a tough military border lord.  His name comes from guarding the "marches" or major routes for invasion.
The jitte is a short metal club resembling a lopsided, two-tonged fork, which is good for blocking and catching swords.  In Japan it was long used as a nightstick and symbolizes a keeper of order.
