陰
-- negative 「イン」
The roof shows that this is the shaded side of the terraced hill, where people are now meeting (combined character sharing the roof) to do things they'd rather hide.  It represents shadow, secrecy, and negative energy.
This is Yin from the famous Chinese philosophical notion of Yin and Yang.
